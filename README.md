# Speech-To-Speech-Text-Classifier

- Identified and integrated the Speech-to-Text code.
  
- Developed a "Speak" button to activate the speech-to-text feature. When the user speaks, 
the app captures and displays the spoken words. - Merged the speech recognition feature with text classification. After the user completes 
speaking, the recognized text is immediately processed by the text classification system.

- The classification result is shown as text on the screen and is also read aloud to the user 
using Text-to-Speech (TTS)
